It is Ï€ day.

Here is the situation:

Groove is a startup I have been working on since last June, it was started off with Ajay and I, and a week after starting it, my brother Jackson as well. Attention wained, and Jackson and I developed an MVP for our system. in arround December Ajay integrated in Arjun, his son, and then wated to step aside as a co-founder, putting his son in his place.

This was and is akward. I ignored it, and more and more it came up.

Here is the hard thing. Arjun is not currently competent at sales, nor marketing, nor product. Ajay is the best I know at all of those things. What is one to do in this situation? Ajay is a friend even though he has put me in an extreemly hard situation. They both keep asserting that
the company should be 50% mine and 50% Arjuns (A notion that makes me quite upset all things considered). I have never nor will ever agree to that notion, rather whenever it is said I have found myself stairing off into space not knowing what to say. In reality, I see the following breakdown being the most reasonable in terms of equity in the company.

-60% me
-30% Ajay / Arjun
-10% Jackson

I honestly think that is fair.

There are some other things to worry about with Groove of course. If it is actually a 10x solution like I hope it to be, then why is it that other companies such as Veeps.com and the like are not 10x?

There is something here, though I don't know how to get to it. It feels as if it is on the tip of my tounge. *Focus on the product, not the process*. 

That is important. 

How do I make Groove 10x? How do I make Groove truely remarkable.

The benefits of *making it digital* are self-evident. But what does that look like?

I'm not sure. Ajay simply says "Veeps is just doing a livestream, not an immersive experience." though what the fuck is that? I don't know.

I am going to do an in-depth analysis of this and report back.
