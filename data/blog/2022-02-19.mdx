Well, this is my first blog post. I am not entierly sure what I am going to put here, but I suppose it will be good as a makeshift journal, as I have never been entierly good with keeping such things active.
Honestly, I just love creating websites (not that wordpress crap, but an honest to god programmed site), and being able to use this domain name to do so makes me quite happy.

I have been setting up a podcast recently and developing out the basement to be a place to host it. I'll probably attach some photos in the next post.

_why make a podcast?_

Well, to be honest, I feel as if there are certain talking points that are not publically expressed enough. I have a more 'Libertarian' style approch to life... though I would never associate myself to the
actual Libertarian party, those guys are a bunch of morons. So, what are my views? I would say I am socially liberal and economically conservative. Live and let live insomuch as it does not effect another's
freedom to do such.

Honestly, I thought that everyone shared this point of view; the only discrepency being what it means to infringe on someone's freedom... though I have talked to people who have said they don't even agree with this,
which I find extreemly strange.

So, what does it mean to infringe on another's freedoms? Well, first off, what is meant by _another_?

Some people say this is humans, some say it is only chineese, white, or black people; though should the 'in-group' of who gets life, liberty, and persuit of happiness be limited to those born in the human family?

Some give a hard and fast yes. In my experience, when pressed on this point these people will ultimatly fall back to a religeous argument of humans having a soul and being way higher than other species.
Another point of view could be that humans are your tribe, and the tribe is what matters (_I am a bit more sympathetic to this point of view_).

Personally, I think other species have the right to not have suffering. A pig is in most tests smarter than a dog, and most people feel it is morally wrong to eat a dog, so why not a pig?
Granted eating a dog is a bit like evolutionary-companionship backstabbing.

Anyways, those are my thoughts for now, I am going to focus on creating some videos.
