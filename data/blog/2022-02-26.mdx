After some thought, I decided to make some _moral axioms_ that I should abide to follow.

Now, some of these are contradictory in some ways, however, this is taken to mean that such principles are good, and should be weighed against the other principles when making a decision.
Sadly, I have not found a simple way to reason out complex issues from these axioms.

**Tony's Axioms:**

1.Life is good.

2.Death is bad.

3.Suffering is bad.

4.Greater intelegence has a greater capacity for suffering.

5.Greater intelegence is better than lesser intelegence.

6.Freedom is good.

7.Supporting your tribe is good.

8.Chaos is bad.

The idea behind defining your moral axioms is that you should be able to minimize the cognitive dissonance between your different actions.

For example, lets say I am trying to determine if I should eat meat. From the first two axioms, I should seek to minimize death and maximize life. A plant based diet certainly kills less organisms than a meat based diet.
From axioms 3, 4 and 5, a plant based diet would indeed minimize suffering and prefer animals over plants (though of course we are prefering plants here as well since less plants have to be killed to support a life when the animal middle man is cut out, though I do rate a plant's life less than that of an animal).
We see then that plant based diets directly follow from our first 5 axioms. Axioms 6, 7, and 8 has reasoning in a less direct way that I will not go into here. From these axioms, I can then deduce that having a plant based diet will give the least cognitive dissonance, and thus should be adheared to.
(on a side note, I have found the line between Vegan and Vegitarian to be harder to draw, and if the animals are indeed being treated very nicely –not at all what we see in most dairy and egg farms– then perhaps it can be moral to be vegitarian).

Things such as the Pro-Life, Pro-Choice debate are a bit harder to reason out than this dietary restriction, even though abortion (_in most cases_) is pretty easy to reason as a moral wrong; but the restriction by the state is another matter entierly.

Anyways, I thought I would present this idea here, and hope it can be useful to others. Although our friend Gödel has proven out that any set of axioms can not implement a closed logic system, I am sure it can be useful as a thought exersize for people to find out what their core beleifs are.
