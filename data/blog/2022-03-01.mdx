I was bored today during work so I decided to make a productivity tool.

Many of the greats (Musk, Zuckerberg, Gates, Bezos, ect.) have reported that they hyper-manage their day. The methodology they sling is not a simple to-do list, but rather seperating tasks into time estimates and using that to compile out what a day should look like (think in terms of blocks of 5 minutes... not much can be done in less than that anyways).

One could go through and build out their day using a traditional planning calendar app, but these are cluncky as you must spend a bunch of time formatting and fitting the times to be appropriate. For me, the thing that matters most is how long it will take.

With this in mind, I created [My Panner](https://stonecoldthoughts.com/planner), a tool that you simply type in your tasks and how long it will take, and it will line it up on your day's schedule. I added in some buttons to follow along with the current time, and save to the server I threw together for this.
I think this methodology will prove to increese my productivity by somewhere between 1.8 and 2.5x. This is kind of like pre-compiling your day; everything runs much faster when the plan of what you should be doing is in place.

I added in a lock to given events if it is important that it is done at a certain time (ex: a meeting that needs to be done at 8:00am). When the lock is enabled, it remains fixed and the events slide around it when you need to edit durration or add somethin in that was missed.

One of the most important things is to break down each step into detailed parts â€“this is pre-compiling after all. Doing such will allow you to work rather than think about what to do when you are in the mindset to execute.

Finally, I add in "Buffer" periods to allow for time to catch up.

All-in-all, I think this 5 minute hyper task method is a great way for anyone to optimize their day... and this tool is a great way to save time putting it together!

Well, this advert for something that I only made for myself is over. I plan to password secure the editing of my planner, but since I am the only one who knows about this site, I think I will be fine for now. If you want to mess with my planning, then that is your own problem.
